Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it can be partitioned into two parts such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.

Example 1:

Input: N = 4
arr = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: YES
Explanation: 
The two parts are {1, 5, 5} and {11}.


Solution:

1) Take target as target/2 if target%2 == 0 then call recursion function it will not be possible to partition in equal half.
2) either include an element or exclude an element if any of the combinations makes target zero it means we found a subset
3) base condition: if we reach to index == 0 and target!=0 then that means its false
4) If the target becomes negative then we can also return false as we don't need to take that scenario.
